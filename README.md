# OP-EX-Mod

My OverPowered Mindustry Mod

[THIS MOD HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED FOR NOW]

Description/Info: I took Anuke's example mod and removed a few items like the silver turret. I then edited most-to-all the files to make everything more overpowered and easier to obtain (everything in the mod is now free to craft). Some people would kind of see this like a cheat mod, idk it's your opinion.

Update V1.8 {The Mender Update}:

- Modded the mender (not tested)

- Updated to V1.8
