# OP-EX-Mod

My OverPowered Mindustry Mod

Description/Info: I took Anuke's example mod and removed a few items like the silver turret. I then edited most-to-all the files to make everything more overpowered and easier to obtain (everything in the mod is now free to craft). Some people would kind of see this like a cheat mod, idk it's your opinion. Maybe in the future I can edit other modder's mods if you want me to and/or just make modpacks for people (by combining multiple mods into 1 folder mod thing). Might add new things in a much later update if I feel like it.

How to donwload: Do NOT press on Download Source (Zip). Press on the .zip file of the mod (on top of README.md) and press download on the right side when you press on the 3 vertical dots.
